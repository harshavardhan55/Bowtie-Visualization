# Risk Story Summary: A commercial vehicle operates daily on public roads, where multiple factors can lead to a loss of control. Threats such as driver fatigue, distraction, and over-speeding increase the likelihood of the top event occurring. Prevention barriers, including rest policies, in-cab cameras, and speed limiters, work to stop these threats before they reach the top event. If loss of control still happens, mitigation barriers like ABS, airbags, and emergency response reduce the severity of consequences such as collisions, rollovers, or injuries. This bowtie shows how each barrier contributes to keeping drivers, cargo, and the public safe.
